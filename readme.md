# Urjo clone

## What this is

This is a clone of the popular web puzzle game [urjo](https://urjo.com) that I completely rewrote from scratch with the help of the original developer and a couple of other people from the urjo discord, so that it can be played fully in just a web browser or in an embedded web browser in a phone app.

## Prerequisites

You only need to have npm and a fairly modern browser installed

## Usage

Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/tonyxforce/urjoclone.git`
Move into it: `cd urjoclone`
Install Typescript with `npm i -g typescript`
Compile the project using `npx tsc`
Either open `index.html` in a browser or use python for example to spin up a local webserver using `python -m http.server 8000` and open [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) in a browser
